I know what you are thinking, you want this in your sim... Well do i have good news, this repo will install the patch using a non user friendly ui (there is an option to revert the patch, that i will most likely never implement into the installer but you can do it manually)

should this be a MSFS package? Yes, but this is easier than figuring all that out...

Is this a massive waste of time? Yes

how to use if you are dumb: `cargo run`

why rust and not python? why dont you ask Joe Biden
